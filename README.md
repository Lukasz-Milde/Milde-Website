# Milde-Website
Welcome to my website.
Like every frontend developer, I decided to build my own website, where I would be able to express myself aesthetically and regularly update the section with recent projects.
I like to keep things as simple and efficient as possible.
In fact, this is only the first stage of building this site. I plan to develop existing sections as well as add new ones. I also plan to improve the existing code.
I hope that your visit to this website was pleasant to the eye and left a good impression.
This is not the end of the development, just a small stop on a long and exciting journey.
